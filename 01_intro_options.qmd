## What Are Derivatives?

**Derivative securities** are financial instruments whose values are *derived* from an underlying asset, index, or rate.

::: {.incremental}
- **Underlying assets** can be:
  - Stocks, bonds, commodities
  - Currencies, interest rates
  - Market indices
- Value fluctuates based on changes in the underlying
- Used for hedging risks and speculation
:::

## Trading Venues

::::  {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Exchange-Traded**

- Traded on regulated exchanges (CME, NYSE, ICE)
- Standardized contracts
- Centralized clearing
- Price transparency
- High liquidity
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Over-the-Counter (OTC)**

- Private bilateral contracts
- Customizable terms
- Higher counterparty risk
- Less transparency
- Tailored solutions
:::

## Options

For the remainder of this lecture, we'll focus on **options** - the most versatile derivatives.

::: {.incremental}


- **Call option**: Right to **buy** an asset at a fixed price (the strike)
- **Put option**: Right to **sell** an asset at a fixed price (the strike)

The buyer pays the seller a **premium** upfront for this right.
:::


Options are particularly important for several reasons:

::: {.incremental}
- **Widely traded**: Billions of contracts annually across global exchanges
- **Versatile**: Can be used for speculation, hedging, or income generation
- **Building blocks**: Understanding options helps with other derivatives

:::

## Option Basics: Key Terminology

::: {.callout-note}
#### Essential Terms

- **Premium**: Price paid to buy the option
- **Strike Price (K)**: Fixed price at which option can be exercised
- **Expiration Date**: When the contract ends
- **Exercise**: Using the right granted by the option
- **Underlying Asset**: The financial instrument the option is based on
:::

## American vs. European Options

Despite the names, both trade worldwide!

::::  {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**American Options**

- Can be exercised **any time** before expiration
- More flexibility
- More common on exchanges
- Slightly more expensive
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**European Options**

- Can only be exercised **at expiration**
- Less flexibility
- Simpler to price
- Common in indices and OTC contracts
:::
::::

## Rights, Obligations, and Motivations

::::  {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Option Buyers (Long)**

- Pay premium upfront
- Have **rights**, no obligations
- Choose whether to exercise
- Max loss = premium paid
- Motivations:
  - Speculation with leverage
  - Hedging/insurance
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Option Sellers (Short)**

- Receive premium upfront
- Have **obligations**
- Must fulfill if exercised
- Potentially unlimited losses
- Motivation:
  - Collect premium income
:::

## Patterns in Option Prices: Strike Effects

Experimenting with the market data reveals consistent patterns:

::: {.incremental}
**Call Options:**

- Prices **decrease** as strike prices increase
- Call with strike $50 > Call with strike $100
- *Why?* Lower strike = more valuable right to buy

**Put Options:**

- Prices **increase** as strike prices increase
- Put with strike $100 > Put with strike $50
- *Why?* Higher strike = more valuable right to sell
:::

## Patterns in Option Prices: Time Effects

**Time to expiration matters:**

::: {.incremental}
- Longer-dated options cost **more** than shorter-dated options
- Why?
  - More time for favorable price movements
  - Greater flexibility (American options)
  - Higher uncertainty

This pattern holds for both calls and puts,
:::



## Intrinsic Value

**Intrinsic value** = What the option is worth if exercised immediately (or at expiration)

::::  {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Call Option:**

$$\text{Intrinsic Value} = \max(S - K, 0)$$

- If $S = \$50$, $K = \$40$
- Intrinsic value = $\$10$
- Can buy at $\$40$, sell at $\$50$
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Put Option:**

$$\text{Intrinsic Value} = \max(K - S, 0)$$

- If $S = \$50$, $K = \$60$
- Intrinsic value = $\$10$
- Can buy at $\$50$, sell at $\$60$
:::
::::

## Moneyness: ITM, ATM, OTM

Options are classified by their relationship to the current price:

| Moneyness | Call Option | Put Option |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **In the Money (ITM)** | $S > K$ | $S < K$ |
| **At the Money (ATM)** | $S \approx K$ | $S \approx K$ |
| **Out of the Money (OTM)** | $S < K$ | $S > K$ |

- **ITM**: Positive intrinsic value
- **ATM/OTM**: Zero intrinsic value

## Time Value and Time Decay

**Time value** = Option price - Intrinsic value

::: {.incremental}
- Options are usually worth **more** than intrinsic value before expiration
- Why? Potential for favorable price movements
- **Time decay**: Time value decreases as expiration approaches
- At expiration: Time value = 0, Option value = Intrinsic value

American options are always worth **at least** their intrinsic value (otherwise arbitrage!)
:::

## Key Insights About Options

Options differ fundamentally from other financial instruments:

::: {.incremental}
1. **Non-linear payoffs**: Not just multiples of the underlying
2. **Asymmetric risk/reward**: Different for buyers vs. sellers
3. **Time decay**: Value erodes as expiration approaches
4. **Volatility sensitivity**: Option prices increase with uncertainty
5. **Multiple dimensions**: Price, time, volatility all matter

These properties make options powerful but complex!
:::


## Trading Options on Exchanges

Most options are traded on organized exchanges:

::: {.incremental}
- **Standardized contracts**: Fixed strikes and expirations
- **Transparent pricing**: Public order books
- **Clearinghouse guarantee**: Eliminates counterparty risk
- **Most positions closed before expiration**: Through offsetting trades rather than exercise
:::

## Strikes and Maturities

Exchanges determine which options are available:

::: {.incremental}
- **Strike prices**: Added to bracket the current market price
  - New strikes introduced as underlying price moves
  - Typically spaced at regular intervals

- **Expiration dates**:
  - Weekly, monthly, and quarterly options
  - New expirations added as older ones expire
  - Availability depends on trading interest
:::



## Open Interest and Contract Creation

Unlike stocks, options have **no pre-existing supply**:

::: {.incremental}
- **Long position**: Option buyer
- **Short position**: Option seller
- **Open Interest**: Total number of long (= short) positions

**How open interest changes:**

- New buyer + New seller → Open interest **increases**
- Existing buyer sells to new buyer → Open interest **unchanged**
- Existing buyer and seller both close → Open interest **decreases**
:::


## Volume and Open Interest Patterns

Understanding trading patterns:

::: {.incremental}
**Concentration Near Current Price:**

- Volume/open interest highest within 10-20% of current price
- Far OTM options trade infrequently
- Wider bid-ask spreads for less popular strikes

**Popularity of OTM Options:**

- Lower cost → higher leverage
- Attractive for speculation (large % returns possible)
- Used for tail risk hedging (portfolio insurance)
:::

## The Life Cycle of Open Interest

Open interest evolves over an option's life:

::::  {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Initial Growth:**

- Starts at zero for new series
- Grows as traders discover it
- Peaks when several weeks/months remain

**Example:**

- Day 1: Trader A buys 10 calls from Trader B → OI = 10
- Day 2: Trader C buys 5 from Trader D → OI = 15
- Day 3: Trader E buys 3 from Trader A → OI = 15 (unchanged)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Decline Phase:**

- Decreases as expiration approaches
- Traders close positions
- Risk managers avoid near-expiry options

**Final Settlement:**

- ITM options: auto-exercised
- OTM options: expire worthless
:::

## Payoff vs. Profit Diagrams

Two important ways to visualize options:

::::  {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Payoff Diagram**

- Shows intrinsic value at expiration
- Function of underlying price $S$
- Ignores premium paid/received
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Profit Diagram**

- Shows actual profit/loss if held to expiration
- Payoff minus premium paid
- Or payoff plus premium received
:::

## Long Call: Payoff and Profit

Buying a call option (bullish strategy):

```{python}
#| label: fig-long-call-slides
#| fig-height: 450
#| echo: false

K = 100
premium = 5
S = np.concatenate([np.linspace(0, K, 50), np.linspace(K, 140, 50)])[:-1]

call_payoff = np.maximum(S - K, 0)
call_profit = call_payoff - premium

fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=S, y=call_payoff, mode='lines',
                        name='Payoff at Expiration', line=dict(color='blue', width=2)))
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=S, y=call_profit, mode='lines',
                        name='Profit or Loss', line=dict(color='red', width=2, dash='dash')))
fig.add_vline(x=K, line_dash="dot", line_color="gray", annotation_text=f"Strike = ${K}")
fig.update_layout(xaxis_title="Underlying Price at Expiration ($)",
                 yaxis_title="Payoff or Profit ($)", template="plotly_white",
                 height=450, legend=dict(x=0.02, y=0.98),
                 yaxis_zeroline=False, xaxis_zeroline=True, xaxis_zerolinecolor='black')
fig.show()
```

## Long Call: Key Characteristics

::: {.incremental}
**Market View:** Bullish (expect price to rise)

**Maximum Profit:** Unlimited (as $S$ increases)

**Maximum Loss:** Premium paid ($5 in example)

**Breakeven:** Strike + Premium = $105

**Best for:** Speculating on upside with limited downside risk
:::

## Long Put: Payoff and Profit

Buying a put option (bearish strategy):

```{python}
#| label: fig-long-put-slides
#| fig-height: 450
#| echo: false

put_payoff = np.maximum(K - S, 0)
put_profit = put_payoff - premium

fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=S, y=put_payoff, mode='lines',
                        name='Payoff at Expiration', line=dict(color='blue', width=2)))
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=S, y=put_profit, mode='lines',
                        name='Profit or Loss', line=dict(color='red', width=2, dash='dash')))
fig.add_vline(x=K, line_dash="dot", line_color="gray", annotation_text=f"Strike = ${K}")
fig.update_layout(xaxis_title="Underlying Price at Expiration ($)",
                 yaxis_title="Payoff or Profit ($)", template="plotly_white",
                 height=450, legend=dict(x=0.2, y=0.98),
                 yaxis_zeroline=False, xaxis_zeroline=True, xaxis_zerolinecolor='black')
fig.show()
```

## Long Put: Key Characteristics

::: {.incremental}
**Market View:** Bearish (expect price to fall)

**Maximum Profit:** Strike - Premium = $95 (limited by $S \geq 0$)

**Maximum Loss:** Premium paid ($5)

**Breakeven:** Strike - Premium = $95

**Best for:** Portfolio insurance, speculating on downside with limited risk
:::

## Short Call: Payoff and Profit

Writing (selling) a call option:

```{python}
#| label: fig-short-call-slides
#| fig-height: 450
#| echo: false

short_call_payoff = -call_payoff
short_call_profit = premium - call_payoff

fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=S, y=short_call_payoff, mode='lines',
                        name='Payoff at Expiration', line=dict(color='blue', width=2)))
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=S, y=short_call_profit, mode='lines',
                        name='Profit or Loss', line=dict(color='red', width=2, dash='dash')))
fig.add_vline(x=K, line_dash="dot", line_color="gray", annotation_text=f"Strike = ${K}")
fig.update_layout(xaxis_title="Underlying Price at Expiration ($)",
                 yaxis_title="Payoff or Profit ($)", template="plotly_white",
                 height=450, legend=dict(x=0.02, y=0.8),
                 yaxis_zeroline=False, xaxis_zeroline=True, xaxis_zerolinecolor='black')
fig.show()
```

## Short Call: Key Characteristics

::: {.incremental}
**Market View:** Neutral to bearish (expect price to stay flat or fall)

**Maximum Profit:** Premium received ($5)

**Maximum Loss:** Unlimited (as $S$ increases)

**Breakeven:** Strike + Premium = $105

**Risk:** Very high! Limited upside, unlimited downside
:::

## Short Put: Payoff and Profit

Writing (selling) a put option:

```{python}
#| label: fig-short-put-slides
#| fig-height: 450
#| echo: false

short_put_payoff = -put_payoff
short_put_profit = premium - put_payoff

fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=S, y=short_put_payoff, mode='lines',
                        name='Payoff at Expiration', line=dict(color='blue', width=2)))
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=S, y=short_put_profit, mode='lines',
                        name='Profit or Loss', line=dict(color='red', width=2, dash='dash')))
fig.add_vline(x=K, line_dash="dot", line_color="gray", annotation_text=f"Strike = ${K}")
fig.update_layout(xaxis_title="Underlying Price at Expiration ($)",
                 yaxis_title="Payoff or Profit ($)", template="plotly_white",
                 height=450, legend=dict(x=0.02, y=0.98),
                 yaxis_zeroline=False, xaxis_zeroline=True, xaxis_zerolinecolor='black')
fig.show()
```

## Short Put: Key Characteristics

::: {.incremental}
**Market View:** Neutral to bullish (expect price to stay flat or rise)

**Maximum Profit:** Premium received ($5)

**Maximum Loss:** Strike - Premium = $95 (if $S \to 0$)

**Breakeven:** Strike - Premium = $95

**Use case:** Collect premium while willing to buy stock at strike price
:::

## Summary of Basic Option Positions

| Position | Market View | Max Profit | Max Loss | Breakeven |
|----------|-------------|------------|----------|-----------|
| **Long Call** | Bullish | Unlimited | Premium | $K +$ Premium |
| **Long Put** | Bearish | $K -$ Premium | Premium | $K -$ Premium |
| **Short Call** | Bearish | Premium | Unlimited | $K +$ Premium |
